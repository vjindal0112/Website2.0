What is the point of a blog and what are my reasons for starting one? When I was young, I was always confused at the point of the blog, why do so much work just so that a couple of people occasionally read something you have written? What I didn’t understand was the personal gain in creating a blog. Even without followers, a blog is a commitment to a consistent search for knowledge. It isn’t easy thinking about what to write, I’ve always struggled with in-class essays and writing pieces. Continuing to find things that interest me and committing to this search is my main reason for starting this blog. My goal is to write one post every week about something random. I’m not sure whether my posts will have a theme, but I’m excited to find out.
